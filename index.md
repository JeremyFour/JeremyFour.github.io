### Educational and Professional Background
I am an educator with multiple college degrees, currently pursuing an Associate's degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS) at Tohono O'odham Community College as an online student. My educational journey reflects my ongoing commitment to learning and professional development, particularly in the areas of computer science and data science. While I have a broad understanding of most computer science concepts, I am working to develop specialized skills. I also have a strong interest in project management methodologies and applications.
### About Me
I am an education professional with a passion for technology and data-driven problem solving. Based in Oklahoma, I balance my academic pursuits with family life as a husband and father of four. When I'm not exploring new coding concepts or managing projects, I enjoy reconnecting with nature through cycling, kayaking, and hiking. This blend of analytical thinking and outdoor exploration fuels my approach to both professional challenges and personal growth. I believe in the power of education to transform lives and am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge base, particularly in the intersection of education, technology, and data science.
### What I Am Excited About Learning in Earth Data Science
I'm particularly enthusiastic about learning how Earth Data Science can bridge my interests in education, technology, and data science in general. I'm excited to explore:
* Geospatial data analysis techniques
* Methods for visualizing complex  data to make it more accessible
* Ways to incorporate remote sensing data
* Applications of machine learning to identiy patterns
* Techniques for creating interactive data dashboards
